# GuardProxy

GuardProxy is a tool that allows owners of minecraft servers to detect malicious proxy connections. It works in real time on the basis of <b>milions of banned IP addresses</b> collected every day and over the last year of GuardProducts (GuardHexa / GuardSpigot). Addictionaly API searches the websites with most popular proxy lists <b>every 5 minutes</b> and <b>blocks them</b>, so any new addresses that could potentially be used by bots are blocked immediately.
